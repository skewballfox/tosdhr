The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.
Some take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.
If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.

California Consumer Privacy RightsYou have certain choices regarding your personal information, as described below.


Access: You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months.

Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.

Opt-Out of Sale: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.


How to Submit a Request. To submit an access or deletion request, please log into your Foursquare account or call us at (855)-505-8916.
To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, click here or email us at privacy@foursquare.com.
You must provide us with your device identifier, which we will use to fulfill your opt-out request.
If you do not know your device identifier, below are instructions on how to locate it.
We will not use the information you provide as part of your request for any purpose other than to fulfill your opt-out request.

If you use an iOS operating system, a third-party application is required to locate your Apple IDFA.
Please note that we do not control such third-party tools and are not responsible for their content, their privacy policies, or their use of your personal information.
If you use an Android operating system, open the Google Settings app on your Android device and select “Ads.” Your Advertising Identifier should be listed at the bottom of the screen.

To submit a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a consumer, please send us a notarized power of attorney and/or other legal documentation.
Requests from agents that do not submit sufficient proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf will be denied.
For questions or concerns about our privacy policies and practices, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us” section of our Enterprise Services Privacy Policy.

Verifying Requests. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.
If you have an account with us, we are unable to fulfill your access or deletion requests at this time because there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by California law.
The reason for this is that Foursquare historically has not linked IP addresses, device identifiers or other information collected through automated means to named actual persons unless the individual uses the Consumer Services.

Additional Information. If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.

440^Transparency^Details are provided about what kind of information they collect^"What are your thoughts on internet privacy?
Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years.
Their marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you.
Adding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.
At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:

Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.
Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.

This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities."^332

Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.
What do I do?
All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.
We do not process any requests related to them.
But sticker sets, channels, and bots on Telegram are publicly available.
If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.
Please note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.

Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?
Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.
To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal public content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.
For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.
User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.
Whenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.
Please note that this does not apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.
For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.
This goes against our founders' principles.
While we do block terrorist (e.g.
ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions"^310

They can then download and decipher the file.
This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.

To have a minimum of control in scenarios where our website is abused, for example denial-of-service attacks, we configured our webserver to create a so-called acces log.
This log file contains a list of all requests made to this server, each request in a separate line.
The logged lines contain the following information:

the IP address that was used to make the request
a timestamp
the URL
the HTTP status code
the user agent the user‘s browser sends automatically

We need to keep logs of the IP addresses sending requests to our server.

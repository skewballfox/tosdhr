# Terms of Service; Didn't Have to Read

a model for annotating terms of services and privacy policies, trained on data available from [ToS;Dr](https://tosdr.org/), which hopefully will eventually make the jobs of the volunteers easier

## Getting Started

### Installation

The quickest way to get started is to use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install the dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/skewballfox/tosdhr
cd tosdhr
poetry install
```

this readme is a WIP
